# Future Goals

## Long-Term Goals
1. Define errors manually.
2. Implement plotting and large data handling features.
3. Handle bytecode for conditions and functions.
4. Add support for threading.
5. Enable string slicing and operations.
6. Resolve types effectively.

## Tasks already resolved
1. Resolve types.
2. Create schema.
3. Implement bytecode for functions and loops.
4. Solve Project Euler problems.
5. Provide good examples demonstrating implementation.

## Final Goal
1. Enable string slicing and user-friendly features.
2. Add threading support.
3. Implement numeric array operations (may prioritize this now).
4. Finalize and polish all features.
