# Getting Started

Nexus is a powerful high-level, dynamically-typed, lexically-scoped, expression-oriented, imperative programming language.

### Installation

Follow these steps to install Nexus:

1. Download the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/lucifer-reborn473/Our_Compiler).
2. Run the installer for your operating system.
3. Verify the installation by running `nexus --version`.

### Hello, World!
The below steps describes how to write a simple progam in Nexus that outputs "Hello, World!" onto the screen.
1. Open a directory in your favorite code editor.
2. Create a file `helloworld.nex`
3. Enter the below code:
    ```
    displayl "Hello, World!";
    ```
4. Save the file.
5. Open terminal and write `nexus helloworld.nex` and press enter!  

Woohoo! You just wrote your first "Hello, World!" program in Nexus.

# Enter Nexus!
- Every statement must end with a semicolon
- Every statement is an expression (returns a value)
- Printing outputs
    - The `display` keyword prints the expression following it. It returns `None`.
    - The `displayl` keyword prints the expression following it with the newline character. It returns `None`.
    - Each of the below statements prints the newline character:
        ```
        displayl ""; 
        display "\n";
        ```
- Taking inputs
    - `feed` keyword, followed by an optional expression to print, takes in input in string format and returns it.

- Valid identifier: Made of English letters only

### Datatypes
#### Primitives:
- Numbers
- Strings (must be enclosed in double quotes)
- Booleans (`True` and `False`)
- `None`  
#### Compound Datatypes:
- Array
- Hash
- Class

### Comments
- Single-line comments begin with /> and continue until the end of the line
    Example:
    ```
    var a = 40+2;   /> a holds 42
    displayl a;     /> 42
    ```
-  Multi-line or expression-embedded comments using `/~ ... ~/`  
    Examples:
    - Expression-embedded comments:
        ```
        var price = 100;    /> INR per KG
        var quantity = 3;   /> KGs
        var discount = 0.3;
        var total = price * /~ discount * ~/ quantity; /> INR
        ```
    - Multiline comments:
        ```
        /~
        The below program
        outputs team name
        ~/
        displayl "Team Nexus";
        ```

### Variables
- Declared using the `var` keyword. Redeclaration is not allowed in the same scope and is caught before evaluation.
- Initialization defaults to `None`

### Strings
- Must be enclosed in double quotes
- String operations:
    - Concatenation using `+`
    - `char()` and `ascii()` functions (respectively equivalen to `chr()` and `ord()` in Python)


### Operators
Basic operators include:
- Arithmetic
    - operators include `+`, `-`, `*`, `%`, `/`, `รท` and `**` 
    - follows left-associativity (except the exponentiation `^` operator which follows right-associativity)
    - Note: `รท` has a higher precedence compared to `/`

- Assignment
    - Values assigned to variables using the assignment (`=`) operator
        - A statement like `var a = ;` raises a syntax error
    - Compound Assignment operators include `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`

- Comparison
    - operators include `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`

- Logical
    - operators include `and`, `or` and `not`

- Bitwise
    - operators include `&`, `|`, `^`, `>>`, `<<`, `~`

- Precedence

- Examples:
    - `5>3` evaluates to True but as 1 when used in an expression as:
        ```
        var a = (5>3) + 99;
        displayl a;
        ```
        Output:
        ```
        100
        ```

More operators discussed in their respective sections

### Conditionals
- Valid syntaxes:
    - `if ... then ... else ... end;`
    - `if ... then ... end;` (if condition is false, then evaluates to `None`)
- Nesting supported
- Empty `then` and/or `else` expressions returns `None`
- Examples:
    - Using braces (`{...}`)
        ```
        var a = if 2==2 then {
            displayl "inside then";
            42;
        } else {
            displayl "inside else";
            7;
        } end;
        displayl a;
        ```  
        Output:
        ```
        inside then
        42
        ```

    - Conditionally evaluating expressions
        ```
        var b = if 2!=2 then a else 5; /> a is not declared in this scope but the code runs without error!
        displayl b;
        ```  
        Output:
        ```
        5
        ```

    - Nesting:
        ```
        var a = if 4<3 then if 3==2 then 5 else 100 end else 1000 end;
        displayl a;
        ```
        Output:
        ```
        1000
        ```

### Loops
- `for` and `while` loops supported with similar syntax as in C/C++.
- Example:
    ```
    for(var i=0; i<10; i+=1){
        displayl i;
    }
    ```
- `moveon` statement equaivalent to `continue` statement in Python.
- `breakout` statement equaivalent to `break` statement in Python.

### Functions
- There are two types of keyword for declaring functions in Nexus:
    - `fn` for non-recursive functions (does not calls itself)
    - `fnrec` for recursive functions
- Redeclaration is not allowed in the same scope and is caught before evaluation.
- Calling a function with empty body returns `None`
- Examples:
    - The below example declares and calls a function `giveSum()` which takes two parameters `a` and `b` and returns their sum
        ```
        fn giveSum(a, b){
            a+b;
        };
        displayl giveSum(40, 2);
        ```
        Output:
        ```
        42
        ```
    - Function to calculate the nth Fibonacci number:
        ```
        fn fib(n){
            if n==1 or n==2 then 1 else fib(n-1) + fib(n-2) end;
        };
        displayl fib(10); /> outputs 55
        ```
        Note: fib(31) takes nearly 22.8 seconds, while fib(32) takes nearly 35.4 seconds (averaged over 3 iterations)

#### Functions are first-class citizens in Nexus
- Example 1:
    ```
    var x = 100;
    fn bar(){
        x;
    }
    fn foo(g){ 
        g() + 2; /> takes function as parameter
    }
    displayl foo(bar);
    ```
    Output
    ```
    102
    ```

- Example 2:
    ```
    fn foo(){
        fn bar(){
            x+2;
        }
        bar; /> returns a function
    }
    var x = 40;
    var y = foo(); /> assigns to a variable
    displayl y();
    ```
    Output
    ```
    42
    ```


### Arrays
- Declared using the `array` keyword
- Initialised with elements enclosed in square-brackets
- Elements can be of any type
- Element access through indexing (index enclosed in square-brackets)
- Mutability?
- Different methods are supported for arrays which are accessed using the `.` opeator.
    - Supported methods:

    - Examples:

### Hash Tables
Hey BG, please add:
- Declaration syntax
- Access methods
- Common operations (adding/removing keys, checking existence)
- Iteration techniques

# Scoping
- Nexus is based on lexical (or, static) scoping.

- structural hierarchy of scopes made during parsing
    - lexical structure captured while parsing
    - helps identify and catch duplicate declarations for variables and functions
- resolution of values during the evaluation phase (see Example 6 below)

- Conditionals and loops have their own local scopes

- Example 1:
    ```
    fn foo(i){
        if i==1 then var a = 2 else 5 end;
        a = 42;
    };
    displayl foo(1);
    ```
- Example 2:
    ```
    var x = 9;
    fn bar() {
        x;
    };
    fn foo() {
        var x = 100;
        bar();
    };
    displayl foo();
    ```
    Output
    ```
    9
    ```


- Exampl 3:
    ```
    var x = 2;
    fn foo(){
        var x = 300;
        x;
    };
    fn bar(x){
        x += 1000;
        x;
    };
    fn baz(x){
        if x<5 then foo() else bar(x) end;
    };
    displayl baz(4);
    displayl baz(6);
    ```
    Output:
    ```
    300
    1006
    ```

- Example 4:
    ```
    var x = 1000;
    fn foo() {
        fn bar() {
            x;
        }
        var x = 117;
        bar();
    }
    displayl foo();
    ```
    Output
    ```
    117
    ```

- Example 5:
    ```
    var a = "g-";
    fn foo(x, i){
        if i==1 then var a = "1-" else "dummy" end;
        if x==1 then "k" else a + foo(x-1, i+1) end;
    };
    displayl foo(5,1);
    ```
    Output:
    ```
    g-g-g-g-k
    ```

- Example 6:
    ```
    fn foo(i){
        fn bar(){
            i;
        };
        fn baz(){
            bar();
        };
        if i==10 then baz() else foo(i+1) end;
    };
    displayl foo(0);
    ```
    Output:
    ```
    10
    ```
